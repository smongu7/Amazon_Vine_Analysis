# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this module and analysis was to introduce us to the concept of big data and practice working with it using pyspark. In order to do this, we learned how to:
- define big data
- describe some challenges of big data
- define Hadoop
- name main elements of Hadoop's ecosystem
- explain how MapReduce processes data
- define Spark
- explain how Spark processes data
- describe how NLP collects and analyzes text data
- use and explain AWS S3 as well as relational databases for basic cloud storage
- complete an analysis of Amazon customer reviews
## Results 

- There were 266 total Vine reviews.
- There were 38,829 total non-Vine reviews of home improvement items.
- There were 125 5-star Vine reviews.
- There were 18,246 5-star non-Vine reviews.
- 46.99% of Vine reviews were 5 stars.
- 46.99% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars. 

## Summary: 

According to the results of this analysis, there was no positivity bias for paid reviews. The percent of paid versus non-paid reviews that gave 5 stars were both 46.99%. Thus, there was no difference in percentage between paid versus unpaid reviews. Thus, there was no positivity bias. However, I would also recommend filtering for verified purchases and see how much that impacts the percent of paid and unpaid 5-star reviews.
